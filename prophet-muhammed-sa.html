                        Born in Makkah in 570 CE, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was an orphan who grew up with immense integrity, earning the title "Al-Amin" (The Trustworthy).

                            He was born into the noble tribe of Quraysh, but lost his father before birth and his mother at a young age. He was raised by his grandfather Abdul Muttalib, and then his uncle Abu Talib. His early life was marked by humility, honesty, and a profound disinterest in the idolatry and societal ills around him.

                        At the age of 40, while meditating in the Cave of Hira, he received the first verses of the Quran through Angel Jibreel (AS), marking the beginning of his prophethood.

                            He was accustomed to secluding himself in the Cave of Hira for contemplation. One night, Angel Jibreel (Gabriel) appeared to him and commanded him to "Read!" The Prophet (PBUH) replied that he could not read, and after repeated commands, the verses of Surah Al-Alaq (96:1-5) were revealed. This was a profound and transformative experience, which initially caused him great fear, but Khadijah (RA) immediately comforted and affirmed him.

                    <p>
                        For three years, the Quraysh imposed a severe social and economic boycott on the Prophet's clan, Banu Hashim, forcing them into immense hardship.

                            The Makkans wrote a document to sever all ties (marriage, trade) with the Banu Hashim unless they surrendered Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). They were confined to a narrow valley, suffering starvation and extreme deprivation. The boycott eventually ended due to internal divisions among the Quraysh and the steadfastness of the Muslims.

It was during this journey that the five daily prayers were ordained.

                            The battle occurred when the Makkans marched to protect their caravan. Despite being heavily outnumbered (approx. 313 Muslims vs. 1000 Makkans), the Muslims fought with immense faith and discipline.

                    <p>
                        In 628 CE, the Prophet (PBUH) signed a peace treaty with the Makkans, which initially seemed unfavorable to Muslims but ultimately led to significant long-term gains.

                            While on their way to perform Umrah, the Muslims were stopped at Hudaybiyyah. The resulting treaty included clauses that appeared humiliating, such as returning new Muslim converts to Makkah and postponing Umrah for a year. However, this peace allowed Islam to spread rapidly through peaceful Dawah (invitation to Islam) without the constant threat of war.
                        </p>
