                    These are sayings of Allah relayed by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) but not part of the Quran. The meaning is from Allah, but the wording is from the Prophet (PBUH).

                        Hadith Qudsi are distinct from the Quran (which is Allah's exact words and revelation) and from regular Hadith (where both meaning and wording are from the Prophet PBUH). They typically begin with phrases like "Allah says..." or "My servant says..."

                    <p class="example-text">
                        Example: Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (PBUH) said: "Allah the Almighty said: 'I am as My servant thinks I am. I am with him when he remembers Me. If he remembers Me in a gathering, I remember him in a gathering better than it. If he draws near to Me a handspan, I draw near to him a cubit. If he draws near to Me a cubit, I draw near to him an arm’s length. And if he comes to Me walking, I go to him at speed.'" (Bukhari & Muslim)
